# simuthera-mobile-game
 Unity based mobile game developed in 2020 within the IEEE DEU CS student club.

## Our mission
Our mobile game project "Simuthera", which we have been working on for about 3 months and I had the chance to carry out the project coordinator, has been published on the Google Play Store. There were 2 major reasons why we embarked on such a project: To develop simple mini-games adaptable to physiotherapy treatments and to bring people from different fields together in the game development process. In this project, we had the chance to work with many people from different departments and different periods who are interested in game development. By learning together and researching together, we managed to create Simuthera.
